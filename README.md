# Ok Zoomer - Fabric
(temporary name)

### What? 
Fork of OkZoomer v4, which I'm going to attempt to update to Fabric 1.19.  
Will update readme if this goes anywhere.

### Current State
Loads on Fabric 1.19, but cinematic camera and zoom reduced sensitivity are broken (`MouseMixin.java`)  
Basic zoom functionality works.

Also, the mod configuration is not persistent between Minecraft restarts.

## WORK IN PROGRESS
